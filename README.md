# weather-forecast-06

## Description

This project included the creation of a weather dashboard using two complimetary APIs. The first API is the geocoding API from OpenWeather, and the second API is the OpenWeatherMap that provides current weather information and a 5 day forecast. I am still developing how to select the appropriate information to import from OpenWeather. I have learned a great deal about APIs during this project.

## Usage
